# Introduction
Building a next.js 14 boilerplate so that I can use next.js for my front-end app in the future. I call it `napp` as a short name Next.js Front-end app. For the microservices for back-end services behind, they may be named like `api`, `auth-api`, whatsoever. 

This app will directly connect to database or call api to get data depends on situation I will folk and create separate variants later on.
